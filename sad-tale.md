House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,

Joffrey Baratheon was the one to do Ned in, but his story was only about to being, and let me assure you he will DEFINITELY NOT DIE!

These are Katie's most recent changes. They are not very good.
